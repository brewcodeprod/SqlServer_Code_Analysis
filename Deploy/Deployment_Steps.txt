Deployment Steps:

1. Download a zip file or clone the following Git repository in your system:
https://github.com/brewcodeprod/SqlServer_Code_Analysis/tree/Dev_Code_Review

2. All deployment scripts are under the Deploy folder in this repository. Update the Deploy/properties.txt file to match the paths in your system. Following are the properties in this file:
VsSolutionPath = .NET solution path (cloned in the 1st step above)
DBProjectPath = sqlproj file path along with the file name. This is the database project we want to analyse for SQL coding standards.
SQLRulesPath = SQL_Rules.csv file path along with the file name
OutputPath = Output path where SQL code analysis csv file will be stored
Please make sure that there is double backward slash in all the paths.

3. Open powershell console as an administrator. Change the directory to the Deploy folder and run the script as below:
.\Build_Rule_Engine.ps1 > build_log.txt
This script builds the rule engine and copies the required DLL and PDB files to visual studio extensions folder.

4. Under the Deploy folder, enable (Y) or disable (N) the rules in the SQL_Rules.csv file.

5. Run the powershell script as below:
.\Run_DB_Code_Analysis.ps1 > analysis_log.txt
This script will generate code analysis csv output file in the output path specified in the properties file.
